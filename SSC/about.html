<h1>Surgical Safety Checklist</h1>

<p><p>This app is based upon the WHO Health Organization Surgical Safety Checklist, First Edition, created by the World Alliance for Patient Safety. This was done as part of a larger effort to reduce surgical deaths and complications. More information about this project can be found in Atul Gawande's book, <i>The Checklist Manifesto.</i>. The goals of this project include safer surgery, reduced infection rates, and improved communication between surgical team members.</p>
<p>And it really works. You can find more details about the test protocol and results at this <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa0810119">link</a>, or from WHO itself <a href = "http://www.who.int/patientsafety/safesurgery/checklist_saves_lives/en/">here.</a></p>
<h2>How to Use the Checklist</h2>

<p>Full information on implementing the checklist can be found at this <a href ="http://www.who.int/entity/patientsafety/safesurgery/tools_resources/SSSL_Manual_finalJun08.pdf?ua=1">link,</a> but here's a quick summary. The surgical team consists of all the operating room personnel: the surgeon, anesthesia providers, nurses, and technicians. WHO makes an analogy between an airline pilot and a surgeon: the pilot may be flying the plane, but that is not a solitary role. Different settings will want to adapt the checklist to local conditions. The checklist items balance simplicity with utility. As WHO summarizes, the goal is "to help ensure that teams consistently follow a few critical safety steps and thereby miniminze the most common and avoidable risks endangering the lives and well-being of patients."</p>
<p>A single person needs to be responsible for running the checklist. This is often a circulating nurse, but it can be any team member. The checklist divides the operation into three stages: before induction of anesthesia, before surgical incision, and the period between wound closure and the patient leaving the operating room (Sign Out). The checklist coordinator must be permitted to confirm that the team has completed the checklist items before moving to the next stage. As teams become more experienced with the checklist, members often begin stating aloud their completion of checklist items without requiring the coordinator's intervention.</p>

<h2>Why a Checklist App?</h2>
<p>Because checklists work! If you have suggestions for improvement, comments, criticisms, or complaints, please contact us at dryridgesoftware@gmail.com. This app is a project of Jim Hurst and Dry Ridge Software, intended for free distribution across the spectrum of mobile devices.
<p>And if you're read this far, and have not read Gawande's <i>The Checklist Manifesto</i>, let me take this opportunity to highly recommend it.</p>
